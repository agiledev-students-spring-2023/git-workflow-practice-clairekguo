## [ChatGPT passes exams from law and business schools](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/tech/chatgpt-passes-exams/index.html)
This article highlighted the findings of a test conducted by a few graduate professors, in which ChatGPT was able to pass various law and business exams with high C to low B grades. I found this to be interesting because it introduces a whole new realm of potential drawbacks and benefits of artificial intelligence technonogies. The results of the tests showed that ChatGPT struggled with basic math and the most classic components of law exams. Given this and the fact that it was able to score grades comparable to the most average student, it raises an interesting discussion on how ChatGPT and other similar software could help students and professionals by providing a reliable starting point, rather than focusing on its use as a means of cheating. 

## Response from Robert Zheng
I personally feel that the justification to use ChatGPT as a templating software and commenting that it makes "surprising" math mmistakes is largly a placating tactic to take concern away from the lack of regulation on the technology at the moment since it's being shown to be more concerningly powerful especially in the presence of human refinement.

    This article is very interesting. When I have used ChatGPT, I feel as if it is often incorrect. It makes sense that it passed, since it uses the internet as a resource for information, and it also makes sense that it did not pass with very high marks.
